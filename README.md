# DllDump
This is a place that I put hard to get Dlls, If they are here it is because the official source is no longer easily available.  There are no guarantees these are up to date, only that they were functional when I placed them here.

# Note
Examples (if included) will likely be in the form of a linqpad script, linqpad can be found here http://www.linqpad.net/ 
But the examples should be easily translable to a console app, minus the .Dump() functionality.
